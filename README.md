# High-Performance Implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

This repository contains the code and documentation for the **High-Performance Implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform Using the Cooleyâ€“Tukey Algorithm**. The project explores iterative and recursive implementations of the FFT, GPU-accelerated solutions, and various optimization techniques using CUDA.

## Overview
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the high-performance implementation of the FFT using:
1. **CPU-based Cooley-Tukey Algorithm** (Recursive and Iterative)
2. **Naive GPU Implementation**
3. **Optimized GPU Implementations**:
   - Shared memory and streams
   - Zero-padding to mitigate bank conflicts
   - Synchronization overhead reduction

This project provides a comparison of execution time between CPU and GPU implementations, showcasing how GPU optimizations drastically reduce computational overhead.
